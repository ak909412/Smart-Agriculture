# Smart Agriculture System

Welcome to the Smart Agriculture System repository! This project aims to revolutionize farming practices by leveraging IoT technology to monitor soil moisture levels and detect intruders in the farm area. With automated alerts and actions, you can ensure optimal soil conditions and enhance security for your agricultural operations.


## Features

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Constantly monitors soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor.
- **Automatic Irrigation**: Turns on the water pump when soil moisture levels are low, ensuring your plants receive adequate hydration.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Utilizes a Lidar sensor to detect any unauthorized intruders in the farm area.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email alerts to the owner whenever soil moisture levels are low or an intrusion is detected.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Agriculture System, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the soil moisture sensor, water pump relay, and Lidar sensor to your ESP8266 board according to the provided schematics.
2. **Software Setup**: Install the necessary libraries for ESP8266 and configure your WiFi credentials in the code.
3. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to your ESP8266 board.
4. **Run the System**: Power on the system and monitor the serial console for status updates.

## Usage

Once the system is up and running, it will continuously monitor soil moisture levels and farm perimeter. Here's how you can utilize the system effectively:

- **Monitor Dashboard**: Access real-time data and receive alerts through a web dashboard connected to the ESP8266.
- **Receive Email Alerts**: Stay informed about soil moisture levels and intrusions by configuring your email address in the code.
- **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune soil moisture threshold levels and intrusion detection parameters according to your specific requirements.
